# Crate: create_mock_db

A crate that builds a mock version of the postgres database 'tuber' that runs on the tuberTrader site:
https://github.com/kiraoyd/tuberTrader

This crate allows rustys-root-review to run independently of the tuberTrader site itself.

More information and instructions how to run can be found at the top level rustys-root-review project README.md file.
