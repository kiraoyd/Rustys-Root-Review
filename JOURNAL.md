# A Journal of my progress building Rusty's Root Review for Bart Masseys Programming in Rust course Spring 2023

5/11/2023

A late start on this repo, but a start. I'm setting up the files needed for the project now, using doggr_w23 as a reference.
I have been working on updating Tuber Trader so it'd DB can be ready to run with Root Review, but it's still in progress.
I'm not sure how to go about building this here in a seperate repo, and testing it against tubers DB.
I believe I can link to the DB using the postgres URL, and just ensure Tuber Trader is up and running in Docker when I make test requests through this server.
